# Steam-Game-Insights-What-Makes-a-Game-Popular-
 
Steam is the worldâ€™s largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, hosting thousands of games across all genres. In this project, I analyzed over 27,000 games on Steam to discover what factors drive a game's popularity and player engagement.

**Project Type:** Exploratory Data Analysis + Machine Learning

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
 
**Objectives:**
The project aims to answer key questions such as:
- What makes a game popular?
- Does price affect user ratings or ownership?
- Which genres lead to longer average playtime?
 
**Key Takeaways:**
- Positive ratings are more closely associated with playtime than price.
- Certain genres (e.g., RPG, Strategy) tend to have longer playtime.
- Many of the most-owned games are older or free-to-play titles.
 
**Limitations:**
- Owner counts are given as ranges and are approximations.
- Reviews do not capture sentiment, just counts.
- Game success may be influenced by external factors (e.g., marketing, IP recognition).
 
**Next Steps:**
- Use machine learning to predict ownership or rating from features.
- Build an interactive dashboard to explore Steam data dynamically.
