Steam is the worldâ€™s largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, hosting thousands of games across all genres. In this project, I analyzed over 27,000 games on Steam to discover what factors drive a game's popularity and player engagement.
 
Objectives:
The project aims to answer key questions such as:
What makes a game popular?
Does price affect user ratings or ownership?
Which genres lead to longer average playtime?

**Key Takeaways:**
Positive ratings are more closely associated with playtime than price.
Certain genres (e.g., RPG, Strategy) tend to have longer playtime.
Many of the most-owned games are older or free-to-play titles.
 
**Limitations:**
Owner counts are given as ranges and are approximations.
Reviews do not capture sentiment, just counts.
Game success may be influenced by external factors (e.g., marketing, IP recognition).
 
**Next Steps:**
Use machine learning to predict ownership or rating from features.
Build an interactive dashboard to explore Steam data dynamically.
